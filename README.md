# devices.css
This repo was modified from [marvelapp/devices.css](https://github.com/marvelapp/devices.css). I took the same devices and made them resizable.

Read about it on CSS Tricks (coming soon).

## How to use it

* Download *devices.css* and use it in your project. Adjust the values of the `--size-divisor` variable if desired. Look at *index.html* for a basic example.
* If you want to process changes to *devices-old.scss* (if the original library updates or you have a different fork of it), simply save the updated version as *devices-old.scss* and run `python process.py` in the directory.
